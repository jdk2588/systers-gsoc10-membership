Welcome to the %(real_name)s@%(host_name)s mailing list!  Please send any questions or comments to %(real_name)s-owner@%(host_name)s.

Instead of having each message go to every user, as with conventional mailing lists, each message is part of a conversation, and users can opt out of conversations that do not interest them.
  
To begin a new conversation, send your message to:

  %(real_name)s+new@%(host_name)s

Alternately, if you would like to specify a name for your new conversation, send your message to:

  %(real_name)s+new+name@%(host_name)s

replacing "name" with the name you would like (e.g., %(real_name)s+new+greetings@%(host_name)s).

To continue an existing conversation, simply use your mailer's "reply-all" command.

By default, you will get all messages.  You can, however:

- Opt out of any conversation by following the directions in the message.

- Change your preferences so you only see the first message in each conversation.  If you wish to see further messages in a specific conversation, you can easily opt in by following the directions in the message that interests you.

If you ever want to unsubscribe or change your options (e.g., switch to or
from digest mode, change your password, etc.), visit your subscription
page at:

  %(optionsurl)s

We encourage you to visit the page now to set your preference for receiving messages
in plain text or html format.  (We recommend html if your mailer supports it to get
the full benefits of the software.)

You can also make such adjustments via email by sending a message to:

  %(real_name)s-request@%(host_name)s

with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.

You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  It is:

  %(password)s

Normally, Mailman will remind you of your %(host_name)s mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
